### The Book of Food
Make sure to create a good README.md with a short description, install instructions, a contributors guide and a link to the license for your code.

Welcome to the Book of Food! Here, you can find, create, and save recipes. Enter ingredients that you have at home to find what you can make. As you get more comfortable in the kitchen, share your recipes with the community.

### Install Instructions
Clone the repository from https://github.com/jessanderson222/module-one-final-project-guidelines-dumbo-web-102918. When you put it onto your own computer, create a new branch to make any edits.

Before running the program, there are a few steps that you will need to take. Enter "bundle install" into the console in order to get all of the gems. In order to access the database tables, enter "rake db:migrate".

To run the program, use ruby bin/run.rb. The methods are written in the lib/models folder and the bin/helpers.rb file. If you find a bug and wish to submit a change, this is where you will find the code.



### Contributors Guidelines

-Make sure to indent your code for readability
